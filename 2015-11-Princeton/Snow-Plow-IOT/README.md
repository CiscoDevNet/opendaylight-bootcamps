##SnowPlow IoTDM
#####Know road conditions with real­time tracking of snow plows and weather updates.

iPhone code repo: https://github.com/barrasso/Snow-Plow-ODL

###Components:
- DMo

- Google API web app

- Mobile app

- ODL data store (IoTDM) 

###Problem:
- Intense snowfall in cities (like Boston) causes congestion and frustration

- Traditional methods are slow and inefficient in clearing roadways

###Solution:
- Devices are carried by municipal snow plows to track paths/locations
- These devices also get data from weather API to store precipitation values and severity
- Web app creates a visualization of the data on a Google Map instance that shows the real­time snow fall and the affect it has on paths cleared by snow plows

###Value Proposition:
- Cities can track and optimize snow plow paths to clear roadways more
effectively

- Users can see which roads are cleared and which ones aren’t to better
plan their commute

- Cost effective and easy to adopt for cities
